Every day the price of travel was changed due to the demand for public uses. The framework developed for the price prediction is analyzed for the travel plans. For the same travel plan offered at a fixed price for a particular group of customers, our proposed model saw a final fare with a lesser number of errors in predicting customer planning. As time progresses and more data are collected, the supervised learning will produce more accurate results and will be helpful in determining fare optimizer and dynamic availability of adjustments and continuously improve future recommendations.
